# Title: Budget Tracker
### This is a program in C++ that can keep track of your budget and expenses. The program allows you to add income and expenses, and displays a summary of your budget.

## Purpose:
I was doing my finances one day and I thought "Won't be it be nice to have a program that calculate all of my expenses and learn C++ as well"

## The Algorithm:
The program uses a loop to repeatedly display a menu and prompt the user for their choice. If the user selects option 1, they are prompted to enter the amount of income, which is added to the budget. If the user selects option 2, they are prompted to enter the amount of expense, which is subtracted from the budget. If the user selects option 3, the program displays a summary of the budget. If the user selects option 4, the program exits.

Note that this is a very basic program, and there are many improvements that could be made (e.g., error handling, input validation, saving the budget to a file, etc.). However, it should be sufficient for a simple budget tracking tool.
